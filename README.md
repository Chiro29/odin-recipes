# odin-recipes

## Introduction
This is the first project of The Odin Project. In addition to learning how to utilize git and linux commands, I'm taking this course to refresh my memory on HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Assignment:
  - Create an index.html file
  - Create 3 pages, each with a different recipe
  - In the index.html file, add a link for each recipe's page
  - On each recipe page, insert a picture of the recipe, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of recipe steps
